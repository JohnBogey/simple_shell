.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh is a simple shell created by Matthew Salem and Maxwell Lovell for Holberton's simple shell project.
.SS OVERVIEW
The shell reads lines from terminal, interprets, and executes the commands.
.SS INVOCATION
Running ./hsh starts the interactive shell which prompts user before each command.
Piping in a list of commands starts the shell in non interactive mode where it executes those commands
.SS SEARCH AND EXECUTION
hsh takes in two types of commands, builtin commands and normal programs which the shell searches for in that order.
.PP
Shell builtins are executed via internal functions.
If a command does not match any builtin the shell searches the path for a program that matches the command and then creates a seperate process to execute it.
An error is printed if nothing matches the command.
.SS BUILTINS
This section contains a list of built-in commands which perform some operation on the shell process
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  env
   prints the environment
  exit
   stops the shell process
