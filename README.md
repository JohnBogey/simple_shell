# simple_shell

## Description

This project is a custom shell that can take in inputs and run functions or programs. While there are many commands that are normally in a shell that are not present here it is able to do some basic built in functions on long with room to easily add more and along with that it searches the PATH for executable programs that match the input.

## Usage

To use this shell, there are two different ways to start it: Non-interactive and interactive mode.
To enter non-interactive mode pipe into the ./hsh a list of commands. The shell will execute each command and then execute.
To enter interactive mode simply start the program and you will be prompted to type in inputs.

Other than the programs, there are a few commands you can run:

| Command | Function |
| ------ | ------ |
| env | prints a list of environment variables |
| clear | built in alias for clearing the screen |
| exit | stops and exits the shell |
